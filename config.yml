  Here's a list of legit ways:
  - Nitro gifts are `discord.gift`
  - Discord staff always have a `Discord Staff` badge on their profile.
  - Free gifts from Discord will be in your `Gift Inventory` undr `User Settings`.
  - DMs from Discord are sent through an account with a `✔️ SYSTEM` next to their name, not bots.

  Here are some of the scams we're aware of and ways to deal with them:
  - A bot, sometimes even verified, sends you a legit-looking Nitro gift link in an embed, it hides a phishing link → Do not click on the link.
  - Someone is running a giveaway of any sort → Make sure the user has a giveaway role
  - Someone asks you to test their new game → Don't download the game.
  - Someone tells you they reported your Steam account → Do not engage.
  - Someone sends you a Steam trading link → Don't click it, go on Steam instead.
  - Someone sent an image that doesn't seem to load → Don't open the image in your browser, check your internet connection and reload Discord, if it still doesn't load it's a scam.
  - Someone is claiming you're being outed on a server for doing something bad that you know didn't happen → Do not join the server
  - Do not Scan QR Codes
  - Do not open images in your browser
  - Do not download untrusted files

  Enable 2FA if possible under `User Settings → My Account`.
  Leave servers that you are not active in.
  Under `User Settings → Privacy & Safety → Server Privacy Defaults` disable `Allow direct messages from server members`
